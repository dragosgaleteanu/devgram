# DEVGRAM

# Description
Devgram is a Social Network Platform for Software Developers that wish to showcase their GitHub Repositories and build long-lasting connections with fellow coders by writing down their thoughts or opinions, liking posts and leaving comments to further discuss the tackled subjects. The motivation to build this platform was rooted in the drive to create a both interactive and beneficial environment meant for developers that want to build up a network from a small, yet dedicated pool of programmers that seek to help each other grow professionally.

# Outcome
Building this project, which is approximately 4,800 lines in length, helped me enhance my knowledge of Express.js by creating a RESTful API consisting of multiple routes and possible requests, as well as my Redux.js understanding by bridging the gap between frontend and backend through a complex system of several possible actions that can be dispatched according to the inserted information. Moreover, the requests are passed from the interface to the server with the help of the Axios HTTP client.

# Technologies
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM <br/>
Frontend: React.js, Redux.js, HTML5, CSS3
